# Individual Self Assessment Deliverable

## Elections Analysis Step by Step:
- Step 1: Clean all datasets and put them in test folder.
- Step 2: Create 1st python script (FinalProject.py)
  - From the clean data, in CSV form, to analyzing that data through graphs. Each different test gives you a list of command options to perform to all the interesting findings. Using python is the far more automated, and faster overall processing time.
- Step 3: Create 2nd python script ([AutoTest.py](https://github.com/hieppham8083/FinalProject/blob/main/FinalProjects.py))
  - We went one step further and integrated all of our tests into a single script that runs through a properly-formatted folder full of validation data, analyzes all of them, and puts all pertinent results in a specific Results folder for the teammates to review.
- Step 4: Create 3rd python script (DataFrame_to_SQL.ipynb)
  - Upload all test results to AWS and link them from the website for dashboard visualization.
  - Transfer all datasets to SQL for database connects to the website and web app.
- Step 5: Create a website (http://group5.anvil.app)
  - Deploy machine learning model to the website for predicting the total votes and who will win the elections, also created the dashboard visualization for all the interesting findings. Refer to Our Website for details.
- Step 6: Create a web app (https://share.streamlit.io/hieppham8083/finalproject/main/main.py)
  - Furthermore, deploy deep learning NeuralNetwork model to analyze vote turn out from Elections Performance Index Dataset and directly plot all the graphs on the web app. Refer to Our WebApp for details.
